# music-website

In this project, I successfully created a music website named "My Tunes" using HTML and CSS. The design process involved leveraging a sleek hero section featuring vibrant visuals, which enhance the aesthetics of the site. I incorporated a functional navigation bar for seamless user experience, allowing easy access to various sections like Music, Videos, and Gift Cards.
